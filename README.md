### Kajabi Tinymce `focuswriter_icons` icon pack 

This is a template project for creating an Icon Pack for TinyMCE. For instructions on how to use this project, [visit the documentation for Create an Icon Pack](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/creating-an-icon-pack/).

#### Quick guide
Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder, then

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`
2. Place icons in `src/svg`
3. Run `gulp` to build the icon pack
4. Copy the contents of the generated icons file `dist/icons/focuswriter_icons/icons.js` to monolith `app/javascript/common/components/FocusWriter/assets/focuswriter_icons/register.js`
5. Add the path tag `<path d="M0 12H16V16H0V12Z" fill="#D9D9D9" class="tox-icon-highlight-bg-color__color"/>` to the generated `highlight-bg-color` svg
    - The `highlight-bg-color` color will override the stock icon. Inside of the stock icon there is a special `<path>` to display the active color. We need to add that special `<path>` back in.
    - This generator doesn't handle this specific case. ðŸ¥²

#### Dev notes
There's a figma source file that can be used to do this, each layer is named with the name of the icon.

Export each layer as an svg.
