### Kajabi Tinymce `focuswriter_icons` icon pack 

This is a template project for creating an Icon Pack for TinyMCE. For instructions on how to use this project, [visit the documentation for Create an Icon Pack](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/creating-an-icon-pack/).

#### Quick guide
Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder, then

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`
2. Place icons in `src/svg`
3. Run `gulp` to build the icon pack
4. Copy the contents of the generated icons file `dist/icons/focuswriter_icons/icons.js` to monolith `app/javascript/common/components/FocusWriter/assets/focuswriter_icons/register.js`


#### Dev notes
There's a figma source file that can be used to do this, each layer is named with the name of the icon.

Export each layer as an svg.
